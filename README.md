# Asteroids
Classic asteroids game that we all know and love, spiced with some custom features. Press left click to shoot and destroy incoming asteroids. As time goes on and score goes up asteroids will spawn more frequently, move faster and have a more unpredictable path. If you spot an asteroid briefly enter and then miss completely, chances are that it is going to come at you later with more speed, so watch out :D. Feel free to tweak or completely change the code, just have fun.
